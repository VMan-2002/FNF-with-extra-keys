-- Main menu music setting
In the freeplay menu, press Home to set the currently selected song as the main menu music, or press End to reset the menu music back to normal.
Hold Shift while pressing End to enable the new Kade Engine menu music.

-- Song loading
You can just dump songs in there now.
Put the song audio and charts where they go and add it to freeplaySongList.txt, it'll just work.
You don't even need to fix the characters (it'll just default to bf-pixel if the character is invalid)
(Yes you can make new songs with this too)

-- New Manias
You now have 13k, 12k, 21k, and 19k.
I know at least 13k works (in pixel noteskin at least), but the others might be screwed up.
13k uses a combination of 9k and 4k controls (you'll need to rebind them so they're not the same), and the others probably aren't even controllable (and prob dont even work, especially 21k)
Dont blame me it's just tedious to add new controls
There's also 50k for those who want to die in real life (that was a joke (not the part about 50k existing))

= charting =

-- Note sustain limit
It's been increased by 17 seconds. You're welcome, charters.

-- Swap Section
fixed :)

-- Double Section
Press this button to add this section's notes to the other player

= internal =

-- ManiaInfo class
Just an internal thing, not useful for players to need to know.
It just makes it easier for me to manage manias.
It's not finished yet tho
